    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Jilapi, also known as jalebi or zalabia, is a traditional fried sweet pastry popular across the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, and North Africa, often enjoyed during festive occasions. It features a spiral shape, crispy exterior, and a juicy, chewy interior when soaked in sweet syrup.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose flour: 3 cups (360 grams)</li>
        <li>Rice flour or chickpea flour: 4 tablespoons (40 grams)</li>
        <li>Baking powder: 2 teaspoons (10 grams)</li>
        <li>Yogurt (curd): ½ cup (120 milliliters)</li>
        <li>Warm water: 1 cup (240 milliliters), plus more as needed</li>
        <li>Saffron strands: A few threads (optional, soaked in 1 tablespoon warm milk)</li>
        <li>Cardamom powder: ½ teaspoon (2 grams)</li>
        <li>Sugar: 1¾ cups (350 grams)</li>
        <li>Water: 1 cup (240 milliliters)</li>
        <li>Lemon juice: 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters)</li>
        <li>Rose water: 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters)</li>
        <li>Honey: 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters)</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee: As needed for frying (200 milliliters recommended)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix all-purpose flour and baking powder.</li>
        <li>Add yogurt, warm water, saffron (if using), and cardamom powder. Stir until the mixture forms a thick, smooth batter resembling a very thick crepe batter.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl and let the batter rest at room temperature for 6 hours or overnight to ferment, which enhances flavor and texture.</li>
        <li>Prepare the syrup: In a heavy-bottomed pan, combine sugar and water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the syrup reaches a "1-string" consistency—test by taking a small amount, cooling it slightly, and pulling it between your fingers; it should form a single thread.</li>
        <li>Add lemon juice, rose water, honey, saffron, and cardamom to the syrup. Stir well and remove from heat. Let it cool slightly before using.</li>
        <li>Heat oil or ghee in a deep pan over medium-high heat. Test the oil by dropping a small amount of batter; if it rises immediately, the oil is ready.</li>
        <li>Transfer the batter to a squeeze bottle or pastry bag. Squeeze the batter in a spiral shape into the hot oil, forming concentric circles.</li>
        <li>Fry the jilapis until golden brown on both sides, turning as needed.</li>
        <li>Remove the jilapis from the oil using a slotted spoon and immediately immerse them in the warm syrup.</li>
        <li>Let them soak for 2–3 minutes to absorb the syrup, then transfer to a cooling rack to drain excess syrup.</li>
    </ol>
